I am Jiaxin Zhang, a PhD candidate at the University of Strathclyde under the guidance of [Dr.Yashar Moshfeghi ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BaFcnWIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior to pursuing my doctorate, I earned my Master's degree at the University of Sheffield under the supervision of [Dr.Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io//), and completed my Bachelor's degree at Chang'an University. Additionally, I have professional experience as an NLP Algorithm Engineer at TCL Corporate Research Co., Ltd, where I worked for a year and a half.

My area of research focuses on enhancing the numerical reasoning capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), such that it can match human abilities in this domain. Specifically, my interest lies in Multi-Modal learning techniques, which I consider to be a promising approach towards achieving genuine numerical reasoning capacity in AI.

My name is Jiaxin Zhang from China, and currently I am a PhD student of The University of Strathclyde, supervised by [Dr.Yashar Moshfeghi ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BaFcnWIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I finished my Master Degree in The University of Sheffield, supervised by [Dr.Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io//), and my Bachelor Degree from Chang'an University. Before my PhD time, I spent one and half a year working in TCL Corporate Research Co., Ltd as a NLP Algorithm Engineer. 

My research interset is around Numerical Reasoning by AI, particularly in solving numerical reasoing problems in text or table. Hopefully, I will add more and more research work during my PhD area.
